                I'm a developer with a love of learning new technologies, both in front-end user interfaces and back-end server-side programming. I like the occasional ping-pong and percussion, too.

                I started writing code when I was 8 years old, with a book of Smalltalk from my dad.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Seeing that turtle fly across the screen</a>, controlled by abstract patterns of numbers and text, sparked something in me. The infinite possibilities stretched out before me like a computational buffet â€“ and the dishes haven't ran out yet.
